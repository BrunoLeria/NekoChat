  ABSTRACT = {Wolfgang Müller believes that customer satisfaction is the key to future corporate success in European markets. The evidence is the changing nature of competition (decreasing brand loyalties and buyer focus on price versus quality) and the increasing emphasis of companies on keeping customers happy. The author looks at current practice in Europe and suggests ways of implementing customer satisfaction policies.},
